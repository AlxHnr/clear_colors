# Clear Colors

A clear, unobtrusive colorscheme for Vim. It provides a consistent look
between 256 color terminals and GVim and also has an 8 color fallback mode
for older terminals and TTYs. This colorscheme comes both in a dark and
light variant and aims to be complete and consistent. Not all plugins are
supported yet, but it should work fine as long as they link to existing
highlighting groups.
